 * Algorithm:
 *
 * Part I:
 * We note
 *	dP/dt = r P(1-P/K)
 * implies
 *      dP/dt
 *    --------- = d/dt ln(P) =  -(r/K) P + r 
 *       P 
 * Hence, plotting d/dt ln(P)  versus  P  will have a linear trend of slope -(r/K) and
 * intercept r. Thus, for y = mx + b    K=(-intercept/slope)
 *
 * The logarithmic derivative may be better done as dP/dt/P
 *
 *
 * Part II:
 * Second we note that the solution is the logistic (sigmoid function) curve given by
 *
 *     P(t) =		 K
 *		 -------------------------- 
 *	       1 + ([K-P0]/P0) exp[-r(t-t0)]
 *
 * Here P0 is the value of P(t) at t0
 *
 * P(t)( 1 + ([K-P0]/P0) exp[-r(t-t0)] ) = K
 *       
 *	     ([K-P0]/P0) exp[-r(t-t0)] = [K-P(t)]/P(t)   
 *       
 *	  -r(t-t0) = ln([K-P(t)]/P(t)) +  ln(P0/[K-P0]) = ln([K-P(t)]/P(t)) + C
 *       
 * Given an estimate of K from the Part I, a line through a plot of 
 *	   ln([K-P(t)]/P(t))  versus time t will have a slope of -r
 *       
 *	  r(t-t0) = ln(P(t)/[K-P(t)]) + C
 *       
 * Here the ln() argument is flipped around to remove the minus sign.
 *
