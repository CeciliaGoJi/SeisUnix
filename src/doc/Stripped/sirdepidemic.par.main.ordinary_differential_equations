 SIRDEPIDMEIC - the SIRD EPIDEMIC model with			

  sirdepidemic > [stdout]					

 Required Parameters: none					
 Optional Parameters:						
 S0=1000		initial number of susceptibles		
 I0=1			initial number of infectives		
 R0=0.0		initial number of removed (should be 0)	
	 		(not the basic reproducion rate r0	
 D0=0			initial number of dead (should be 0)	

 k=.5			transmission rate			
 b=.3333		removal rate = death + recovery rates	
 nu=0.01		mortality rate 				
 			(0.01 = 1% mortality)			

 h=1			increment in time			
 tol=1.e-08		error tolerance				
 stepmax=40		maximum number of steps to compute	
 mode=SIRD		S, I, R, D successively output		
			=S only, =I only, =R only		
 Notes:							
 This program is really just a demo showing how to use the 	
 differential equation solver rke_solve written by Francois 	
 Pinard, based on a modified form of the 4th order Runge-Kutta 
 method, which employs the error checking method of R. England 
 1969.								

 The output consists of unformated C-style binary floats, of	
 either pairs or triplets as specified by the "mode" paramerter.

 About the SIRD epidemic model:				
 r0 = number of new infections per single infected host  	
  1 < r0 < 1.5 for influenza (2.2 to 2.7 for Covid-19)		
  b, k, S0, and r0 are related via				
  k = b*S0/r0							
  It is often easier to determine the recovery rate k (in units
  of h and to determine reasonable estimate of S0 and of r0 	
  and to calculate the infection rate b = k*r0/S0		
  nu= mortality rate						

 S = total number susceptible to the infection			
 I = total number of those capable of passing on the infection	
 R = total number recovered					
 D = total number dead						

 Examples:							
 Default:							
 sirdepidemic | xgraph n=40 nplot=4 d1=1 &			

 Hypothetical flu in a school models:				

 Without deaths, or with recovered and dead not distinguished:	
 sirdepidemic h=0.1 stepmax=100 b=.3 k=.9 S0=100 mode=SIRD |	
    xgraph n=100 nplot=4 d1=1 style=normal &			

 With 10 deaths (10% mortaliy)						
 sirdepidemic h=0.1 stepmax=100 b=.2 nu=.1 k=.9 S0=100 mode=SIRD |
    xgraph n=100 nplot=4 d1=1 style=normal &			

 sirdepidemic h=1 stepmax=50 b=0.2 k=0.1 S0=1000 I0=1 mode=SIRD |
     xgraph n=50 nplot=4 d1=1 style=normal			

 Hong Kong Flu 1968-1969:					", 
 https://services.math.duke.edu/education/ccp/materials/diffcalc/sir/sir1.html
 Population is S0=7.9 million, r0=1.5, the average period of	
 infectiveness is  3 days so k=1/3, b=r0*k/S0=6.3e-8, and initial
 infected is I0=10.						

 Without deaths, or with recovered and dead not distinguished:	
  sirdepidemic h=1 stepmax=200 k=.3333 b=6.3e-8 S0=7.9e6 mode=SIRD |
      xgraph n=200 nplot=4 d1=1 style=normal			

 With deaths and recovered distinguished .1% mortality:	
  sirdepidemic h=1 stepmax=200 k=.3323 nu=.001 b=6.3e-8 S0=7.9e6 mode=SIRD |
      xgraph n=200 nplot=4 d1=1 style=normal			
 (you will have to zoom in on the plot to see the 12,000 deaths

 Alternatively, if we normalize S0, I0, and R0 by the total	
 population, then S0=1.0 the initial population of infectives  
 becomes I0=1.27e-6, the average period of infectiveness is	 
 3 days making k=1/3, and the possibility of infective contact 
 is every 2 days, making b=1/2.  Note that in the S0=1.0 case,
 r0=1.5 = b/k.							

 Without recovered and dead being distinguished		
 sirdepidemic h=1 stepmax=100 b=.5 k=.333 S0=1.0 I0=1.27e-6 mode=SIRD|
   xgraph n=100 nplot=4 d1=1 style=normal			

 With recovered and dead being distinguished 0.1% mortality	
 sirdepidemic h=1 stepmax=100 b=.5 k=.332 nu=.001 S0=1.0 I0=1.27e-6 mode=SIRD|
   xgraph n=100 nplot=4 d1=1 style=normal			

 Thus, it may be easier to determine b and k with S0=1.0, and
 then try different I0 values

 The SRI model describes an epidemic in terms of
   S = susceptibles in a population
   I = infectives in a population
   R = recovered
   D = dead

   S0 = initial value of the susceptibles
   I0 = initial value of the infectives
   R0 = initial recovered = 0
   D0 = initial dead = 0
   
  Always S(t) + I(t) + R(t) + D(t) = S0 + I0   
   
   r0 = b*S0/k  = basic reproduction rate
   b = rate of infection
   k = rate removal
   nu = mortality rate  
  
   The encounters between susceptibles and the infectives is represented
   by the product S*I  
	S'(t) =  - b*S*I   (S'(t) is always negative)
	I'(t) = b*S*I - k*I - nu*I
	R'(t) = k*I 
	D'(t) = nu*I
 S(t)= susceptible members (no births, deaths, immigration, or emigration)
 I(t)= infective number (includes asymptomatic carriers)
 R(t)= recovered members
 D(t)= dead members

 There is an impiled flow from S(t) -> I(t) -> R(t) or D(t), though infected
 who are quarantined immediately become part of R(t).

 The product b*S*I denotes the interaction of the infective population with
 the susceptible population..
